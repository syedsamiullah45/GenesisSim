# GenesisSim: Autonomous Civilization Simulator in Pure Python

**GenesisSim** is a symbolic, memory-driven civilization simulator built entirely in Python using `pygame` and `Perlin noise`.  
No engines. No sprites. No AI libraries.  
It simulates the natural emergence of belief systems, dreams, roles, memory, mutation, and death â€” all from scratch.

This is not a game. It's a living world, running on logic.

## Features

- Organisms with internal memory, emotion, hunger, and mutation
- Emergent roles: Leader, Shaman, Healer, Cannibal, Rebel, etc.
- Procedural belief systems generated using symbolic glyphs
- Dream simulation that influences behavior and evolution
- Tribe formation based on memory, proximity, and belief
- Disease, energy decay, reproduction, and natural death
- Click to inspect any organism's stats, beliefs, tribe, memory, and dream state
- Toggleable overlays for HUD, dreams, and tribes
- Procedural biome variation and symbolic drift using Perlin noise
